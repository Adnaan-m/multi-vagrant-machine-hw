# Multi-VM-Machines-HW
The following ReadMe provides information in relation to steps taken to create multi vm machines using one vagrant file. The vm machines included the implication of a mongodb database and a simple application. Ensuring that both of these could be run on the same machine with different IP addresses which can be loaded through the web browser. 

### Technologies used
* Vagrant
* Ruby

### How to download
1. Search for Adnaan-m in GitHub. [Click Here](https://github.com/Adnaan-m/multi-vagrant-machine-hw) for the link.
2. Search for the multi-vagrant-machine-hw repository.
3. Download the files displayed.

### Challenges
Not many challenges were faced in this homework, more the concept of executing the correct code in terms of in the execution files and on ZSH. Apart from that, the task was more or less straight forward.

### Learning Points
VM machines are awesome and the usefulness in real world application is a great advantage to have (especially when the system can NOT go down in flames i.e. bank applications).
